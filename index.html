    <h3>Reporting Day</h3>
 <p>I joined AkiraChix on 9th February 2024. I was welcomed hospitably from the gate to the Kaya. <br>
    We had breakfast with our parents while waiting for all students to arrive. <br>
    The hospitality was admirable that even my parent complimented the Campus.<br>
 </p>

    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>I was assigned to Lovelace Lab. <br>
        The class in session was about Navigating Your Journey. <br>
        We talked about
         <ol>
            <li>Our Goals</li>
               <li>Hobbies and Talents</li>
               <li>What we were doing before joining AkiraChix</li>
         </ol>
        For a first class, it was engaging and fun. <br>
        This is because of the introduction session which was lively. <br>
   </p>

   <h5>Accommodation</h5>
   <p> I was assigned to the room called Kalahari which hosts eight people.<br>
    Our room has the following;
    <ul>Bathroom with a bathtub</ul>
    <ul>Cabinets for everyone</ul>
    <ul>Our own balcony</ul>

    <h6>Summary</h6>
    <p> My stay at AkiraChix has been good so far.<br>
     It is a place fit for studies and away from destruction. <br>
     You get a moment to focus on, and build on yourself.</p>
